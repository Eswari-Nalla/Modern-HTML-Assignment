Here are some ways to improve the accessibility of HTML: 
1. Use semantic HTML: Semantic HTML is a good basis for accessibility. It's not more difficult to write than non-semantic markup.
2. Add alt text to images: Alt text provides access to image content for people who can't see the images.
3. Use clear language: Keep sentences short, avoid dashes, abbreviations, and slang words.

Other ways to improve HTML accessibility include: 
 Use proper headings
 Use the HTML lang attribute
 Use descriptive link text
 Add labels to form fields
 Avoid using placeholder text in forms
 Increase contrast
 Use keyboard shortcuts
